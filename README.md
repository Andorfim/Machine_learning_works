# Machine_learning_works

code "classes and clusters"

The first part - 
Here I use the K-means method and the DBSCAN method on a self-generated sample with 4 clusters.

The second part - 
I use the same two methods on the Mall_Customers dataset. 
Data - expenses and finished income

code "difference" - In this code I use Naive Bayes Classifier for determinating songs by David Bowie and Paul Mccartney
